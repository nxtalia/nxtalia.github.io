<h1>My interests</h1>

<h3>Video Editing</h3>
<p>My main hobby is video editing. I use DaVinci Resolve and create various Multi Editor Projects (MEPs, a form of cooperative video projects) with my sister and friends and post them on YouTube. I also sometimes make other type of video content and I love adding cool special effects to the videos I film.</p>
