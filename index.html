<h1>My interests</h1> <hr>
<p>Few months ago I'd have said I love Math, but now I'm not so sure anymore.</p>

<h3>Video Editing</h3>
<p>My main hobby is video editing. I use DaVinci Resolve and create various Multi Editor Projects (MEPs, a form of cooperative video projects) with my sister and friends and post them on YouTube. I also sometimes make other type of video content and I love adding cool special effects to the videos I film.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I really enjoy programming and making my own little projects. At least, when they don't return any errors.</p>

<h3>Reading random articles on the internet</h3>
<p>I'm especially interested in cool creatures (such as dinosaurs, sea slugs, frogs, some insects), technology, but I also sometimes read about space and paradoxes, or literally anything that piques my interest.</p>

<h3>Meme making</h3>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I read quite a lot of books, my favourite genres are fantasy, mystery, thrillers and sci-fi, but I could literally anything that interests me. <br> 
  Some of my favourite books of all time are </p>
<ul>
  <li>"Ranger's Apprentice" John Flanagan</li>
  <li>"Six of Crows" Leigh Bardugo </li>
  <li>"Thief's Magic" Trudi Canavan</li>
  <li>"A Natural History of Dragons" Marie Brennan</li>
  <li>"Red Pyramid" Rick Riordan</li>
  <li>"A Darker Shade of Magic" V.E. Schwab</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drawing & Character design</h3>
<p>I love to draw and design my own characters. I also enjoy online art events such as artfight.net (which I'm a really huge fan of).</p>

<h3>Games</h3>

<h3>Webcomics</h3>
